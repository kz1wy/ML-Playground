# ML-Playground

Welcome to **ML-Playground**! This repository is my journey through **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** concepts, implemented from scratch using **Python and PyTorch**. It is designed for anyone looking to understand ML/AI fundamentals by building models step-by-step.

## 🚀 Overview

In this repository, you'll find various implementations of popular machine learning algorithms, ranging from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning models. Each example is built from scratch using PyTorch, with explanations and code to help you grasp the core concepts.

## 📚 What's Inside

- **Linear Regression** (with PyTorch)
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Neural Networks** (Multi-layer Perceptrons)
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **Reinforcement Learning Basics**
- More algorithms and models will be added as the project evolves.

## 💡 Key Features

- **PyTorch Implementations**: All models are implemented using PyTorch, a flexible and efficient deep learning library.
- **Learning-Oriented**: The code is structured to be easy to follow, with clear explanations and comments.
- **Hands-On**: Dive deep into the fundamentals by implementing algorithms from scratch.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simple models and gradually work your way up to more complex architectures.
